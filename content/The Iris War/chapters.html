            <h2>The Iris War</h2>
            <h3>Chapters</h3>
            <p>The first act of the Iris War is set to have seven chapters - two for each of the main factions and an epilogue chapter. Each one takes place in a different country across the world.</p>
            <h4>Chapter 1: Japan (Penta Elite Force)</h4>
            <img src="images/CH1.png" width="50%" />
            <p>Early in the Iris War, the Penta Elite Force and the Nitro Orthodoxy clashed for superiority over Japan. The first chapter tells of how the Penta ultimately prevailed over their Nitro adversaries and took control of the nation by taking them and the civilian militia down. This will be the simplest of all the episodes as I was mainly coming to grips with the OpenRA editor during the development of this campaign.</p>
            <h4>Chapter 2: Saudi Arabia</h4>
            <img src="images/CH2.png" width="50%" />
            <p>The second chapter is of the Nations of Shade's conquest of Saudi Arabia from the Nitro Orthodoxy, using it to bolster their arsenal and taking advantage of the resources. They made their first appearance in the first chapter when they heard of the Penta and Nitro's conflict in Japan and chose to take advantage of it, and now during this conflict, they face the Nitro and later the Penta in trying to get control of the country and use the oil reserves for their army. This is the second campaign I've been working on but needs to be fleshed out just a bit before it's ready.</p>
            <h4>Chapter 3: Brazil</h4>
            <p>The third chapter (which hasn't yet been started) is of the Nitro's conquest of Brazil and the rest of South America from the Shade, who are trying to reactivate the relics that the former Iris Alliance used during the Triage War. They would have to deal with the Shade's cryo technology that the Iris Alliance used back then and either obtain or destroy the relics before they can be utilized. There is also an unknown civilian army that seems to be endorsing the Nitro's efforts, but it's rumored that they were formerly members of the Triage during the Triage War. This campaign will be started and fleshed out more when I finished the Saudi Arabia campaign and another campaign I'm working on.</p>
            <p>The next three chapters (Alaska, United Kingdom, and Australia) need to be fleshed out before they are ready to be talked about. Github is the best place to find updates.</p>
            <h4>Epilogue: U.S.A.</h4>
            <img src="images/EP.png" width="50%" />
            <p>Six months into the Iris War, the nations that were once part of the Iris Alliance are now in disarray, with the three main factions battling seemingly ever day with either each other or with civilian militia groups that didn't approve of the split. With no end in sight to the war, three larger civilian militia groups, called Councils, sought to find one another and stand up to the other factions under one banner, representing the general population of the world. After months of searching, they were able to gather together in the USA, where the conflict between the three main factions had reached a boiling point. This story is meant to be told from a "player" centered perspective, where you would guide the other councils and help form the alliance that consisted of the three Councils. More details will be coming soon!</p>
